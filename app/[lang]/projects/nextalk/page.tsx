                        <p>NexTalk is a live chat application designed to allow users to connect and communicate in real-time. Built as a practice project, its primary goal is to demonstrate the development team's technical skills and ability to create a fully functional, interactive platform. Although NexTalk doesn't offer unique features that differentiate it from other widely-used chat applications, it serves as a comprehensive showcase of core abilities in web development, socket programming, and user experience design.</p>

                        <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold">Scope and Limitations (Demo Disclaimer)</h1>
                        <p>In this demo version of NexTalk, some features have been intentionally limited to streamline the demonstration and focus on core functionality. Please note the following limitations:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <span className="font-semibold">Account Creation:</span> Users cannot create their own accounts. For demonstration purposes, user profiles are pre-configured and hardcoded.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className="font-semibold">Messaging:</span> The ability to send and receive live messages is disabled in this demo version. While the interface reflects the intended chat experience, live interaction is unavailable.

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className="font-semibold">Profile Editing:</span> You cannot modify user profile details, either for yourself or your friends. The demo does not support changes to display names, avatars, or other profile information.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <span className="font-semibold">Friend Management:</span> The option to add or remove friends is also disabled. Friend lists in the demo are static, reflecting the core functionality but not allowing for dynamic user connections. These limitations ensure that the demo runs smoothly while showcasing the application's potential without unnecessary complexity.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <h1 className="text-3xl font-semibold">Development Process</h1>
                        <p>NexTalk was developed using the Next.js framework, a powerful React-based solution known for its performance optimization and scalability in web applications. The projectâ€™s architecture focuses on real-time data handling, user authentication, and responsive design to ensure a smooth user experience across devices. One of the major challenges faced during development was integrating socket-based communication to enable live chatting. This required fine-tuning both the server and client sides to handle real-time updates efficiently. Despite the challenges, the development team successfully implemented a scalable solution that demonstrates proficiency in handling live data streams.</p>
